# All the tasks from the practice
### Task 01
- declare a funciton called ``greeting``
- takes a string argument and returns the user's name

### Task 02
- declare a list of numbers from 0 - 9
- iterate through it and print the list

### Task 03
- using boolean operators, print True if two statements are true

### Task 04
- create a list of five numbers, starting from zero
- create a tuple of five numbers, starting from zero
- change the value of the last index in the tuple

### Task 05
- create a dictionary with two key,value pairs
- first key: name, value: James
- second key: age: value: 18
- display the values and the keys

### Task 06
- create a class called ``Name`` (your name)
- initialise the class to take two arguments
- create an object of that class
- create another object of the same class called ``student``
- print the attributes of both objects

### Task 07
- create a set with values from 1 to 4

### Task 08
- create a method that takes one argument as a string (your name)
- if the name == "(your name)" return true, else return false

### Task 09
- create a class called ``Human`` with one function called ``breathe`` that returns "breathing"
- create another class called ``Student`` that inherits from ``Human``
- create a ``Student`` object and call the function from the parent class

### Task 10
- write some code that allows you use the keyword ``super``

### Task 11
- create a list called ``user_data`` and store numbers 0 to 4 in it
- create a function that takes a list as an argument
- the function returns True if the datatype is a list and False otherwise

### Task 12
- create a function called ``get_percentage`` that takes two integers as arguments
- it should return the percentage of the two arguments

### Task 13
- create a function that takes two arguments as integers
- divide the first value by the second value and *return the outcome*
- if the second value is 0, throw an error with a message stating that you can't divide by zero

### Task 14
- write 5 odd numbers in a list
- write 5 even numbers in another list
- iterate through the lists to combine them and display the new list - write a function to do this

### Task 15
- create a dictionary called ``shopping_list`` with three key: value pairs
- milk: £1; yoghurt: £1.15; ice cream: £2.38
- create a function that takes a dictionary as an argument
- iterate through the values of ``shoppping_list`` and add the values
- return the total cost

### Task 16
- using the dictionary from the previous task, display the cost of yoghurt
